⛔ DEPRECATED. This example demonstrates how to integrate the [Web Document Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17738/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/asp-net-webforms-reporting/document-viewer?v=19.1) in JavaScript app. The project uses the [Bower](https://bower.io/) package manager.

For a step-by-step tutorial, refer to the following help topic: [Basic Document Viewer Integration (With Bower)](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119336/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/javascript-reporting/document-viewer/integration-examples/basic-document-viewer-integration-with-bower?v=19.1).

Starting from v19.2, you should use the **npm package manager**. For more information, review the following help topic: [Reporting for Knockout-based Applications](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/401917/web-reporting/javascript-reporting/knockout).

The current repository and the DevExpress Reporting Bower package will not be updated in the future.
